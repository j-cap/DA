\chapter{Summary and Outlook} \label{cha:summary}

The main goal of this thesis was to find a way of including a priori domain knowledege into the fitting process of a data driven modeling approach. We showed that this is possible using the concept of shape-constraints, see~\pref{cha:solution-approach}, and B-splines as well as additive regression for multi-dimensional data as presented in~\pref{cha:practical-considerations} and~\pref{cha:real-world-application}. Further, we presented an overview of the related literature regarding the topics of linear models, model selection and B-splines in~\pref{cha:fundamentals}. 

With regards to future work, it would be interesting to try to create an algorithm that automatically finds the best possible combination of B-splines and tensor-product B-splines for a multi-dimensional problem with some a priori domain knowledge. For example, using 3 inputs, there are various combinations possible to create an additive model, e.g. a B-spline for dimension 1 and a tensor-product B-spline for dimension 2 and 3. An algorithm that automatically chooses the optimal combination with respect to some predefined criterion would help to enhance the usage of this approach.

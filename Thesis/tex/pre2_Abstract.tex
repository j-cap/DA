The massive amount of data generated in industrial processes leads to an increasing use of data-driven methods in control applications. A priori domain knowledge about these processes is often available and not utilized. Nevertheless, its incorporation is expected to enhance the quality  and robustness of the data-driven model. 

In this thesis, we propose an iterative algorithm to incorporate the given a priori domain knowledge into the modeling process using shape-constraint P-splines for one and two dimensional problems. The algorithm is expanded to higher dimensional problems using the concept of additive models. We further evaluate the quality of the proposed method using simulation data as well as real-world examples.

The results suggest that the proposed method enhances the quality of the fit especially in situations of sparse and/or noisy data. We therefore conclude that the use of shape-constraint P-splines to incorporate a priori domain knowledge is a valuable extension for any data-driven modeling tool set.
